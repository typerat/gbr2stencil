# gbr2stencil

This application generates drill files to produce solder paste stencils on a CNC milling machine.
Drilling a stencil is much more forgiving on tool setup and also much faster than milling.
Beverage cans are a good (and free) material for solder stencils.

I've implemented this application to suit my needs exactly. It's been tested with Gerber files exported from Eagle and KiCAD. Also, the code is a mess, but works.
If you decide to give it a try, please report any problems or ideas for improvement.
